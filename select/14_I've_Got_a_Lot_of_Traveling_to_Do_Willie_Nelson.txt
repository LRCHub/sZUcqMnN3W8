I've got a lot of travelling to do
A whole lot of travelling to do
Talk about a mover who has way too much to lose
This time I put back on my rambling shoes

I've got a lot of travelling to do
I've got a lot of travelling to do
A whole lot of travelling to do
Well the road's getting crowded

And they're shortening my view
And there ain't nothing here that I really care to lose
I've got a lot of travelling to do
I've got a lot of travelling to do

And I can't forget the shit you put me through
And of course I can't forgive you
Cause that's just what I do
But I've got lot of travelling to do

I've got a lot of travelling to do
Whole lot of travelling to do
I'm gonna fire one up I'm gonna burn it down
And load it right by you
But that wouldn't write a song
Got a lot of travelling to do

Got a lot of travelling to do
And I can't forget the shit you put me through
And of course I can't forgive you
Cause that's just what I do
Got lot of travelling to do

Got a lot of travelling to do
And I can't forget the shit you put me through
And of course I can't forgive you
Cause that's just what I do
But I've got a lot of travelling to do
