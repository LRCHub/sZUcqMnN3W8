Well she stole my heart it seems
And she threw it in a grave
Oh, she's got me traveling open roads
In search for headlights and new days

Oh, she's got me traveling
Oh, I'm traveling
She's got me traveling
Oh, I'm traveling

Well dark clouds are over me
As I'm rolling across towns
Oh, I've got sore bones and heavy thoughts
As I leave it all behind

Oh she's got me traveling
Oh, I'm traveling
She's got me traveling
Oh, I'm traveling

Oh, she's got me traveling

Down, down again
Oh, I'm traveling
Down, down again
