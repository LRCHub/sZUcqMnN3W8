We always have been wanderers, we slept under the stars
There were so few among us, to keep our fires warm
The winter came so early, we saw it as a sign
He lead us far from home, now we're traveling through time

There were so many houses, we had to close our door
To separate and doubt us and then invent the war
But our hearts stay hungry, we feel we're going blind
We're more than this, believe me, we're traveling through time
Traveling through time

Rise, brothers, rise
We take us by surprise
As part of all the universe
We're traveling through time

Rise, sisters, rise
And take off your disguise
We'll go back to the origin
We're traveling through time
Traveling through time

We're going all through changes, our world stands never still
We're making our arrangements and follow our free will
And life is a big riddle, we're making our rhyme
In fact we are so little, we're travelling through time
Traveling through time

Rise, brothers, rise
We take us by surprise
As part of all the universe
We're traveling through time

Rise, sisters, rise
And take off your disguise
We'll go back to the origin
We're traveling through time
Traveling through time
